# Database Setup Complete! ✅

## What Was Done

Your custom `users.dat` file has been successfully integrated and configured for the University Management System.

### 1. **Password Hashing Applied**
   - Original file had plaintext passwords
   - Created utility to hash all 165 passwords
   - Applied DJB2 hash algorithm (same as system uses)
   - Replaced original file with properly hashed version

### 2. **Database Statistics**
   - **Total Users**: 165
   - **Administrators**: 5 (Adm1001-Adm1005)
   - **Faculty**: 20 (Fac1001-Fac1020)
   - **Staff**: 35 (Stf1001-Stf1035)
   - **Students**: 105 (Stu1001-Stu1105)

### 3. **File Structure Organized**
   ```
   ├── src/
   │   └── main.cpp           # Source code (moved from root)
   ├── data/
   │   ├── users.dat          # Your hashed user database (165 users)
   │   └── LOGIN_CREDENTIALS.txt  # Reference guide
   ├── Makefile              # Updated to use src/ directory
   └── university_system     # Compiled executable
   ```

All login credentials are saved in: `data/LOGIN_CREDENTIALS.txt`

This file contains:
- All 5 administrator accounts
- All 20 faculty accounts  
- Sample staff and student accounts
- Quick reference for testing

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test Authentication**
   - Go to the console above
   - Choose option `1` (Sign In)
   - Try any username/password from the credentials file

2. **Add More Data**
   - Login as administrator (admin1001)
   - Use option `9` to create sample courses
   - This will populate the courses database

3. **Test Different Roles**
   - Login as different user types
   - Explore role-specific menus
   - See how permissions work

```

### Password Hashing
- Algorithm: DJB2 hash (same as main program)
- Storage: Field index 10
- Authentication: Hash input password and compare to stored hash

### Additional Database Files (created on use)
- `courses.dat` - Created when courses are added
- `enrollments.dat` - Created when students register
- `grades.dat` - Created when faculty update grades
- `appointments.dat` - Created when appointments are booked

## ✅ System Status
